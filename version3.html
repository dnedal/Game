        <p><h1>Perfect information about capabilities, asymmetric information about cost of war</h1>
<p>- Players start the game with 30 points each. The first one to reach 100 points wins the game. If a player loses all their points they get knocked out.
- Capability Reveal: Each player draws and reveals one card face up.<br>
- Pie Reveal: Draw and place two cards face up between the players.<br>
- Asymmetric information about cost: Draw one additional card, the "cost of war". Player 2 knows the cost. Player 1 only learns the cost after player 2 decides.<br>
- Proposal: Player 1 proposes a division of the pie. If player 2 accepts the division, each player receives the proposed share of the piece and war is averted.<br>
- Battlefield Resolution: If no agreement is reached, players go to war. The player with the higher card wins the entire pie. Draws go to player 2, the “defender”. Both players subtract the known cost of war.
