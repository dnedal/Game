        <p><h1>Asymmetric information about cost of war, uncertainty about capabilities and resolve. Rock Paper Scissors as a force multiplier.</h1>
<p>- Players start the game with 30 points each. The first one to reach 100 points wins the game. If a player loses all their points they get knocked out.<br>
- Capability Reveal: Each player draws and reveals one card face up.<br>
- Pie Reveal: Draw and place two cards face up between the players.<br>
- Asymmetric information about cost: Draw one additional card, the "cost of war". Player 2 knows the cost. Player 1 only learns the cost after player 2 decides.<br>
- Proposal: Player 1 proposes a division of the pie. If player 2 accepts the division, each player receives the proposed share of the piece and war is averted.<br>
- Battlefield Resolution: If no agreement is reached, the dispute is settled by war. Players play 3 rounds of Rock Paper Scissors, best 2 out of 3 wins a force multiplier and doubles their capabilities.<br> 
- Draws go to player 2, the “defender”. 
- Both players subtract the revealed cost of war.
