        <p><h1>War termination game. Cumulative costs </h1>
<p>- The player is representing the US-led United Nations forces intervening against communist invasion of South Korea. The game begins on September 1950 with the famed Incheon landing.
- Both sides start the game with 30 points each. Earning/losing points moves the game marker North/South as the balance of points between North and South shifts.<br>
-If Player 1 reaches the Yalu river (a point gap of 100 or more), forcing the North Korean forces to sue for peace. If player 1 loses all their points they become unable to continue fighting and sue for peace. If player 2 reaches the Jeju strait (a 100 point gap in their favor), they manage to expel US forces from the peninsula and win the war.<br>
Game steps:<br>
- Draw and place two cards face up between the players. This determines the prize at steak at each round of the game<br>
- Capability Reveal: Each player draws and reveals one card face up. This represents the relative capabilities in a given round. <br>
- Asymmetric information about cost: Draw one additional card, the "cost of war". Player 2 knows the cost. Player 1 only learns the cost after player 2 decides. These costs <i>accumulate</i> over each round.<br>
- Decision time: Player 1 must decide whether to fight, retreat, or propose a cease-fire.<br>
- Fight: whomever has the highest capability card wins the battle. Draws go to P2. The victor reaps the spoils (takes the whole prize). Both players pay the cumulative cost of fighting.
- Retreat: If player 1 retreats, player 2 receives half of the prize. Neither state pays the costs of war.
- Cease-fire: Player 1 proposes a cease-fire, offering a division of the prize. If player 2 accepts the division, each player receives the proposed share of the prize and fighting is averted--temporarily. If player 2 refused the division, fighting resumes and is settled the same way as above.
- If players reach three consecutive cease-fires the war is terminated as a stalemate.
