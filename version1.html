        <p><h1>Bargaining with Perfect Information and Known Costs of War</h1>
<p>- Click "Draw Cards": Reveals the prize the players are disputing, 2 cards. The total prize is the sum of the value of both cards. It also reveals the cost of fighting a war should a peaceful bargain fail, and two capability cards reflecting each player's military power.<br>
- Proposal: Player 1 proposes a division of the prize using the slider and then clicking the "propose" button. If Player 2 accepts the division, each player receives the proposed share of the piece and war is averted. If player 2 rejects the division, the players go to war. The player with the highest card wins the entire prize. NOTE: Draws (cards of equal value) go to Player 2, the “defender”. Both players lose points equal to the cost of war. 
<br>Note: In this game, Player 2 is programmed to maximize their absolute gains.
